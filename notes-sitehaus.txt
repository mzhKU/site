Engineering:

Overview:
Sitehaus is created using Angular 2 and uses Flexbox for the layouting.
The concept is to deliver a minimalistic website that provides all necessary information and still is visually entertaining.
Entertainment should come from visually attractive selection of shapes, fonts, colors, geometries, dimensions, language and animations.
It is inspired by current modern websites but has its own approach about how to accomplish certain tasks.

Implementation Details:
Each page is served as an Angular 'box' component which has properties that map to the content displayed.
The box objects are provided to the root application component.

Problems:
- Labels should be vertically centered in the buttons
- Label font size should be larger but not overflow button areas
  for all view devices
- Lobster font doesn't work on mobile device
- Between the boxes, only one separating line should appear, not two
  (from the above and below box)
- the margins should collapse
- Font size should adjust to size of viewport
